## Coding Process:
This was a pretty challenging first project. At the beginning, I jumped around from file to file, basically working on things that didn't require a lot of thinking. I would work on the HTML, some CSS, and worked on the authorization work that I was already familiar with.

Once it got to working on the game logic and API calls, it got a lot harder. I collaborated a lot with my classes to figure out how to conceptualize the game board, create the functions, and figure out the API calls. That was what the bulk of my time was spent on. I think the hardest challenge we faced was the win functionality.

Once those were figured out and working, I spent time figuring out the CSS, messaging, and prettying up the game. An unexpected challenge that I ran into was adding consistent CSS to the in-game messaging. I found that there were so many different types of messages I'd send (win or lose text, turn text, error messaging) that I wanted to arrange and consolidate others. But this meant that I had to keep adding and removing classes depending on the message's context, and never quite figured it out. I think my only unsolved bug is that when you tie, all of your future win text will be black instead of green.
